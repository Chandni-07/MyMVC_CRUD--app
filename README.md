# MyMVC_CRUD--app
This is Simple CRUD Dynamic Web Application which used tools are jsp,servlet,mysql and created a complete project of CRUD Application for function operations like Add New Data, Update Data, Delete data and Retrieve or View Data.

A dynamic web application using Servlet, JSP, and Oracle Database that can perform CRUD operations! ðŸŽ‰
The application is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which made it easier to organize and manage the code. With MVC, the application's logic is separated into three interconnected components: the model (which represents the data), the view (which displays the data), and the controller (which handles user input and manages the communication between the model and view).
Using these technologies and architecture, I was able to develop a web application that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data from the database, making it an excellent tool for managing information in a variety of contexts.
